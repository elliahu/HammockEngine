# Hammock Engine ðŸ”¥
Custom 3D game engine running on Vulkan. Work in progress.

## Engine dependencies ðŸ“š
The following libraries are used:
- [GLM](https://github.com/g-truc/glm) - Linear algebra (matrix and vector operations)
- [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/) - Window creation and input handling (Subject to change, moving to [SDL](https://libsdl.org/) in near future)
- [TinyObjectLoader](https://github.com/tinyobjloader/tinyobjloader) - Excelent tiny library for object loading

# Roadmap ðŸš—
- [x] Model loading
- [x] 3D transformations
- [x] Basic lighting (Blinn-Phong illumination model)
- [x] Collision detection using AABB (Axis-aligned Bounding Boxes)
- [ ] Basic UI system
- [ ] Shadows
- [ ] Textures
- [ ] Materials and PBR
- ... probably physics and staff ...
