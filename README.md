# Hammock Engine ðŸ”¥
Custom 3D game engine running on Vulkan. Work in progress.

## Engine dependencies ðŸ“š
The following libraries are used:
- [GLM](https://github.com/g-truc/glm) - Linear algebra (matrix and vector operations) 
- [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/) - Window creation and input handling (Thinking about abstracting this myself ...)
- [TinyObjectLoader](https://github.com/tinyobjloader/tinyobjloader) - Excelent single header library for object loading
- [ImGUI](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) - Graphical User Interface library
