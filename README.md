# Hammock Engine 🔥
Custom c++23 game engine using Vulkan - the next generation graphics API.

# Features 🚀
The following points are features currently implemented:
- [x] Collision detection using AABB
- [x] Basic UI system
- [x] PBR (still improving, mainly descriptor binding)
- [x] Deferred renderer
- [x] glTF 2.0 support (still improving, mainly descriptor binding)
- [x] Shadow mapping (still improving, currently only singular directional/spot source)
- [x] SSAO
- [x] Reflections and Cubemaps
- [x] Volumetric rendering and physically accurate clouds
- [x] Full IBL support 
- [x] Runtime mipmap generation
- [x] Runtime environment, generation (prefiltered, irradiance, BRDF lut)

# TODOS ⏱
- [ ] Indirect drawing 
- [ ] Asset system and audio support
- [ ] Physics and collisions
- [ ] Optional RTX features
- Will see what more

## Currently working on (hot stuff)
- Implementing more robust shadow system
- Plug-in system for render systems to expose and sample from frame buffer attachments
